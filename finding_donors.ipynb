    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Reasons for each...\n",
    "**Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "- Logistic regression may be used to predict whether a patient has a given disease (e.g. diabetes; coronary heart disease), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.).\n",
    "- simple to apply and easy to understand and explain (It has been widely used in the industry). It performs well when the decision boundary is reasonably linear. When the classes are linearly separable, there's no need to use more complicated models liike SVM since mathematically they're essentially equivalent. Because of its simplicity and it's fast to compute, it's a good practice to start with logistic regression to set the baseline - adopt more complex algorithms only when improvement justifies it (Occam's Razor). It's also easy to update given additional features. Moreover, it outputs probabilities so it can also be used in ranking.\n",
    "- It tends not to work well when decision boundaries are nonlinear. It is sensitive to outliers (which can be taken care of with appropriate normalization method). It also tends to underperform when compared to ensemble methods (which most winning models in ML competitions are based on)\n",
    "- It's a good cadidate for the problem because it models binary classification and as explained above, a good starting point to set baseline (I chose not to further consider random forest after it scores lower than logistic regression) and to see if a linear model is reasonable. Additional assumptions reasonably satisfied: absence of multicollinearity and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest Classifier:**\n",
    "- In the stock market, random forest algorithm used to identify the stock behavior as well as the expected loss or profit by purchasing the particular stock.\n",
    "- simple to understand - it's just an ensemble of individual decision tree (DT) estimators, with each working on a different random subset of the sample and then combined through voting in the end; compared to a single DT, the ensemble method reduces variance and is less prone to overfitting; unlike boosting, the trees can be computed in parallel for fasting computing; and there's not much parameter tuning needed, in contrary to boosting models. Unlike logistic regression, it's more suitable for nonlinear decision boudaries. \n",
    "- It tends to underperform boosting classifiers in optimality. Also, for it to be more accurate, there's need to grow a large numbers and that slows computation. The results are harder to visualize than those based on a single DT.\n",
    "- It's a good candidate because it's suitable for binary classification. It also complements logistic regression to check for nonlinear decision boundaries. With so many features, a single DT tends to overfit and given a large dataset, growing the forest is likely a better strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Boosting Classifier**\n",
    "- Gradient boosting has been used in face detection and web search ranking. \n",
    "- It's a very powerful method due to learning from previous iterations and focusing on 'errors' (many Kaggle competition winnings used GBC) and it's still simple to understand/ explain - it's ensemble of DTs by assign weights to each tree based on its performance. It allows regularization to reduce overfitting. \n",
    "- It has to be processed sequentially slowing computation and thus less scalable. It can require a lot of parameter tuning to work optimally. It's more prone to overfit than random forest classifier. The results are harder to visualize than those based on a single DT. \n",
    "- It's a good candidate because it's sutiable for binary classification. It works well in a lot of situations and producing superior results, and yet still easy to explain and understand. \n",

    "Gradient Boosting Classifier is a type of ensemble learning. Ensemble models are classifiers that are composed of other classifiers, generally of the same type. In GBC for classification, the ensemble learner is built by incrementally and sequentially training single decision trees to add to itself. The reason it has to be added sequentially is because the training is based on learning from previous mistakes - the misclassified data points from the previous iteration are given more weights so the next iteration will put more focus on correcting prior misclassifications. Through mathematical manipulation, this leads to GBC as a weighted average of individual decision trees based on accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that unlike in bagging, each member decision tree is a weak learner. Weak learners are learners that produce predictions that are just arbitrarily more accurate than random. Therefore, GBC is a strong learner that are built from a collection of weak learners.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Because GBC is a type of ensemble method, it benefits from the most important quality of ensemble methodology: they're less likely to overfit than single learners. However, it's still more prone to overfitting than Random Forest Classifier, which is generated by averaging results from a large number of decision trees, all trained on random subsets of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "GBC has been proven to be a very powerful model. Its predictive scores can often be improved through parameter tuning based on cross validation methods like grid search. Grid search picks the winner by comparing scores for each combination of values for the parameters selected in tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other important qualities of GBC include capabilities to reduce overfitting through various regularization methods and to extract the most important features through features ranking. "

    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "\n",
    "I'm pretty much on point about education too, except the better predictor is education-num (years spent in school), not education (degrees obtained). I don't think it's more relevant than degree obtained because ultimately it's the degree obtained that matters in employment, not how many years one lingered in school.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
